  'about.bio.2': "It didn't stop at just one.",
  'about.bio.3': "It's my way of relaxing. Some people knit sweaters; I fold cranes. I work as a manager, and besides overseeing the company's administrative operations, I handle event production, and this is my way of expressing my own creativity.",
  'about.how.heading': 'How I do it?',
  'about.how.1': "I have an idea, I see colors, I paint the background (sometimes in multiple layers), and then I look for colors in fashion magazines. Sometimes I have them in my head, sometimes I see them in photos, paintings, and sometimes the computer helps me. I arrange cranes, place them on the canvas, and change the order and grouping until it's just right.",
